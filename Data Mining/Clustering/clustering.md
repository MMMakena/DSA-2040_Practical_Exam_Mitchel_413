- ***K-Means clustering*** on the Iris dataset with k=3 generally produces high-quality clusters, as indicated by a strong ***Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score***. The ARI measures the similarity between the predicted clusters and the actual species labels, with values close to 1 indicating good agreement. In practice, most data points are grouped correctly, but some misclassifications occur, especially for samples near the boundaries between species. For example, the overlap between versicolor and virginica can lead to ambiguous assignments, since K-Means relies on feature similarity and does not use label information.
- ***Scatter plots***, in which discrete groups are apparent but some points may fall between clusters, can also be used to visualize ***cluster quality***.  The ***elbow curve***, which shows diminishing returns for more clusters once ***inertia levels*** out after dropping dramatically up to three clusters, further supports the selection of k=3.
- In ***real-life scenarios***, clustering is beneficial for ***customer  segmentation***, market  analysis, and irregularity detection.Companies can use clustering to identify groups of consumers with similar purchasing behaviors, design marketing tactics, and improve product recommendations.
- ***Misclassifications*** are expected in complex, real-world data, but cluster analysis still provides actionable insights for decision-making, resource allocation, and personalized services.
